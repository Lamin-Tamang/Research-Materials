## **_LearningverseVR:_** A game-based learning platform using generative artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies

## **_Abstract_**
Generative AI and virtual reality (VR) has been quickly taking over education and gaming industry. They enhance various fields like education and gaming by creating innovative solutions like enhancing online learning with interactive simulations or developing immersive gaming experiences. However, we still lack immersive game-based learning platforms that fully integrate these technologies. Given this, the article proposes the creation of “LearningverseVR”, an innovative immersive game-based learning platform that integrates generative AI and VR technologies. It aims to feature AI-driven NPCs with diverse personalities for dynamic interactions and VR to further enhance the learning experience of the users. This platform utilizes Unity as the client and uses Python, Flask, and MySQL for backend. "LearningverseVR" offers a unique approach to digital education by merging AI and VR to create an engaging, interactive learning environment.
